**ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Myron**

I'm currently enrolled at Mission Ready HQ taking Salesforce Developer Accelerator program as I aim to become a Saleforce Developer/Functional Consultant.

Things I enjoy learning in this program:
  - Salesforce Flows
  - Object and fields management
  - SOQL
  - Apex

While studying, I'm also working part time as a Senior Customer Experience Specialist (Banking) for Xero.

On the side I'm also learning Java and Web development.

Always keen for a good chat, so feel free to reach out!
